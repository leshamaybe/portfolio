# Leshamaybe Portfolio

![Leshamaybe - Software Engineer in the Russia](https://ucarecdn.com/1681950f-5006-4d07-8fe3-2572168c4cbe/)

This is my portfolio website, proudly built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Tailwind soon](https://tailwindcss.com/). Content management will be done through [Sanity](https://sanity.io/). The default package manager is [npm](#), but you can also use `pnpm` or `yarn`..

This project is a constant work in progress, so if you find any bugs, typos or other errors, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### FormCarry

I use [FormCarry](https://formcarry.com/) to implement a contact form. Register with FormCarry for free to get the API key and add it to your `.env.local` as `FORM_KEY` to make the contact form work.

### Vercel Analytics

[Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) is installed in `/src/pages/app.js`. If you don't want to use Vercel Analytics or don't intend to host your site on Vercel, you can remove this.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
